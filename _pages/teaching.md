As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, I had the privilege of leading 10 physics laboratory courses. Here, I gained a deep appreciation for the amount of
preparation involved in instructing courses, not to mention the rewarding feeling of supporting the academic aspirations of students.

As a graduate student at the University of Michigan, I was hired as a Grader for EECS 230 *Electromagnetics I* under Professor Somin Lee.
