Welcome to my page! I’m a software engineer in the space defense industry at <strong>General Dynamics Mission Systems (GDMS)</strong>. Since 2022, my work has included building lab prototypes for optical quantum communications technology, measuring and enhancing the performance of Rydberg atom-based RF sensors, and developing software using Python and MATLAB for machine learning and interactive data visualizations for space communications programs.

<strong>I'm applying to Ph.D. programs!</strong> Broadly, I plan to merge my academic background in physics/optics with my professional background in software to research the intersection of scientific computing and AI/ML research. I plan to pursue a path guiding generative AI models, like diffusion, with known scientific principles. My goal is to create simulations and scenes rooted in the mathematical framework of physics rather than merely constructing realistic-looking outputs. This approach is critical for deploying generative models in scientific settings, particularly in medical imaging and digital twin development for increasingly complex engineering systems.

Before joining GDMS, I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan (2020-2021) and earned a Master's degree in Physics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (2017-2019). I've also held 2 internship positions with the [Space Communications and Navigation](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/space-operations/space-communications-and-navigation-scan-program/) program at NASA Glenn Research Center, with a focus on Quantum Communications.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time supporting my wife as she excels through Podiatry school, planning out the next national park to visit, or out on the roads running. Running is a significant part of my life, serving both as a stress reliever and competitive pursuit. In recent years, I have focused my training on half and full marathons, including the [Bayshore Marathon](https://www.bayshoremarathon.org/) and [Mesa Marathon](https://mesamarathon.com/).
