My educational journey was driven by a genuine interest in fundamental science, fueled by a <strong>deep passion for learning and tackling complex concepts</strong> that explain the world around us. As I transitioned into the workforce, I discovered a strong passion for data science, particularly in <strong>machine and deep learning</strong>. I have quickly established a solid foundation in this field by developing and measuring the performance of classic supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in my current position at General Dynamics Mission Systems. This evolving interest has inspired me to pursue a career in machine learning and further my education by <strong>applying for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2024</strong>.","location":{"address":"","postalCode":"","city":"Fountain Hills","countryCode":"US","region":"Arizona"},"profiles":[{"network":"Twitter","username":"cstevons","url":""}]},"education":[{"institution":"University of Michigan","location":"Ann Arbor, MI","url":"https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/","area":"Optics & Photonics","studyType":"M.S.
